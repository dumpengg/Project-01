# Adaptive Container Scheduling for IoT-Based Real-Time Environmental Monitoring

The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has enabled real-time environmental monitoring across urban and rural settings. However, the dynamic workload and heterogeneous nature of fog and cloud infrastructures require efficient scheduling mechanisms to minimize latency, energy consumption, and cost. This paper proposes an Adaptive Container Scheduling Framework that leverages fog and cloud resources in a hybrid manner. By dynamically migrating application containers based on workload intensity, network delay, and energy constraints, the proposed method achieves improved Quality of Service (QoS) for time-sensitive applications. The system is validated using iFogSim2 simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in latency, energy efficiency, and cloud cost over traditional static placement strategies.
